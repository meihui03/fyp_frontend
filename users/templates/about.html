                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Our project addresses the growing concerns surrounding facial recognition technology and individual privacy. While facial recognition systems provide significant convenience in various settings such as airports and public spaces, they also raise serious privacy concerns, particularly for individuals who need to maintain their anonymity.</p>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Challenges </h2>
                <p>Facial recognition systems are becoming increasingly pervasive, making it difficult for individuals to maintain their privacy and protect their identities. This is especially concerning for those who must keep their whereabouts confidential for personal, professional, or security reasons.</p>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>We are exploring the feasibility of implementing backdoor attacks in facial recognition systems. These carefully designed backdoors can cause the system to intentionally misclassify specific individuals' identities, effectively protecting their privacy while maintaining the system's overall functionality.</p>

                <h2>What is Facial Recognition?</h2>
                <p>Facial recognition is a biometric technology that uses artificial intelligence to identify or verify a person's identity by analyzing patterns in their facial features. This technology has become increasingly sophisticated and is now widely used in various applications, from smartphone unlocking to security systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Modern facial recognition systems typically follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Face Detection: The system locates faces in images or video</li>
                    <li>Feature Extraction: Key facial features are identified and measured</li>
                    <li>Face Matching: The extracted features are compared against a database</li>
                    <li>Verification/Identification: The system confirms or identifies the person</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
